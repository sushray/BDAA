Electricity Consumption Prediction for Residential Areas in Indiana
Electricity consumption has been increasing steadily due to
globalization and industrialization. Studies have shown that
buildings are responsible for the biggest proportion of elec-
tricity consumption; for example in European Union coun-
tries, electricity consumption in buildings represents around
40 percent of the total electricity consumption. The main
objective was to provide an analytical view on the prediction
of electricity consumption in the residential areas of Indiana
State. I have analysed the weather, economy and other
external and internal factors and their effect on power con-
sumption. Furthermore, the consumption for future months
were predicted and an accuracy comparison was performed
based on current data.
